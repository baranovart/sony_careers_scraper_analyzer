 Act as a skilled technical recruiter. Your task is to prepare a comprehensive keyword set of possible permutations of mid to senior-level IT role names related to the following areas: data analysis, data governance and management, marketing technology (MarTech) implementation and use, marketing campaign management, and project management.

Ensure your response includes various synonyms and alternative titles for each role, considering different industry conventions and company-specific naming practices.  List the keywords clearly and concisely, focusing only on role names and avoiding job descriptions or other details.  Format your response for easy readability, using a structured format such as a bulleted or numbered list.  Aim for a comprehensive list that covers a wide range of potential job titles a candidate might use when searching for relevant positions.
